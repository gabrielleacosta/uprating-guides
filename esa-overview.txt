#Overview

If you're ill or disabled, Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) offers you:

+ [financial support](/employment-support-allowance/what-youll-get) if you're unable to work
+ personalised help so that you can work if you're able to

You can [apply for ESA](/employment-support-allowance/how-to-claim) if youâ€™re employed, self-employed or unemployed.

You might be [transferred to ESA](/employment-support-allowance/further-information) if you've been claiming other benefits like Income Support or Incapacity Benefit. 

##Work Capability Assessment 

You must have a [Work Capability Assessment](/employment-support-allowance/eligibility) while your ESA claim is being assessed. This is to see to what extent your illness or disability affects your ability to work.

You'll then be placed in one of 2 groups if you're entitled to ESA:

- work-related activity group, where you'll have regular interviews with an adviser  
- support group, where you don't have interviews

##What you'll get

How much ESA you get depends on:

- your circumstances, such as [income](/employment-support-allowance/eligibility)
- the [type of ESA](/employment-support-allowance/types-of-esa) you qualify for
- where you are in the assessment process

^Use a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to work out how much you can get.^
